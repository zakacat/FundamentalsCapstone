# FundamentalsCapstone

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this app is to thoroughly prove my knowledge that was provided in the course Codelabs for Android Developer Fundamentals provided through developers.android.com. There was plenty of cross-over between this course and the college Intro to Android App Development course that I took in the Winter of 2021.  
I still find myself having trouble with a couple of these topics, including all the implementations for RecyclerView and Room/SQLite. I hope that putting in a strong effort to coordinate my knowledge into a fully fleshed-out app will help solidify at least the concepts, where there is still a grey area and my brain has yet to connect the dots on what is actually happening.  
This app will also include the concepts that were covered in the phone call and SMS codelab that is also available on developers.android.com as I covered this in a similar time frame (to make a joke app that could send a message with as many iterations as desired).

## **About The App**

The main direction of the app has yet to be decided, but I think it will be a refined recipe app that I can keep with me. It will try to incorporate everything taught in the course if that is at all possible. It should also be a useful app that I can share with friends and family with hopes that a net benefit can be taken away from it. I enjoy cooking and I have a tendency to try one recipe repetitively until it reaches a level of satisfactory deliciousness, then I tend to forget all about it or lose the specific recipe as I move on with my life. Beginner dishes might include Colombian Arepas, vegan chicken wings, vegetarian pizza, tofu stir-fry, etc.

## **Index of Included Content**

Here I will include the list of all the topics covered in the course that I will want to add to the app. Later I may add in depth analysis of the topics; however, my in-code documentation may be sufficient.  

Lesson 1:

- Ensuring that there are log statements
- View elements and View Group, TextEdit and attributes, onClick handlers
- Using the layout editor and design tab to customize UI
- Displaying Toast messages (possibly for every action?)
- TextView elements and ScrollView. Scrolling multiple elements
- Formatting with HTML and escape sequences
- Clickable web links
