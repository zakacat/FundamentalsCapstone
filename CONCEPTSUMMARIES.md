**Tabs and Tab Layout**

To create a tab layout (as described in the course), a support library dependency must be implemented. The Action Bar and Title of the theme must be overridden to not display in themes.xml as to prevent the app from crashing. Use a relative layout instead of a constraint layout for ease of implementation. Add Toolbar, TabLayout, and ViewPager for the fragments in the desired activity layout xml file. Add a fragment class (or plural - one for each tab) and layout file to coincide with each view in the ViewPager. Edit fragment layout to show the items that are desired. Create a custom PagerAdapter (might not be neccesary. It may be possible to do an internal instantiation that also overrides the necessary methods) that can return a new instance of the fragment each time getItem() is called. Extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter. Add number of tabs to be passed in and returned as required. Inflate the Toolbar and TabLayout in the desired activity. Add the PagerAdapter and assign the ViewPager to set the fragment in the ViewPager view when the tab is selected.
